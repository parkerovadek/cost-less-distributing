# Cost Less Distributing

## Spin Up

1. First clone the repo if you have not done so already
2. Copy the environment variables from 1Password into a new `.env` file
3. `pnpm install && pnpm dev` to install dependencies and start the dev server
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` to open the app in your browser

That's it! Changes made in `./src` will be reflected in your app.
